      <h2 id="what-we-will-provide-to-the-komodo-community">What we will provide to the Komodo community</h2>

<p>Our proposal is based on Notary Node architecture improvements. Currently in order to run a notary node, a physical server is needed, with a lot of disk space and RAM. Standard servers allow you to scale only vertically, which means adding RAM modules or disks. With the increasing number of assetchains, a single server might not be sufficient to handle the load. But, what if we split the load between multiple servers? By cutting Komodo/Iguana/Bitcoin/assetchains down into smaller pieces (containers), we could run each piece of the puzzle in a ditributed manner accross multiple nodes.</p>

<!--
### Current work
We already started with dockerizing Komodo platform.

- dockerizing Bitcoin/Komodo/Iguana combo to make the deployment frictionless
- decoupling of Notary Node software from baremetal and deployment onto Openshift/Kubernetes
- having a central Docker registry with signed images
- management scripts will need to be rewritten because they were designed to work on single machine

You can check our progress here:


<iframe src="https://ghbtns.com/github-btn.html?user=patchkez&repo=kmdplatform&type=star&count=true&size=large" frameborder="0" scrolling="0" width="160px" height="60px"></iframe>

At some point, we will merge our changes into one repo.

### Pros of proposed solution
- portability across machines - Docker containers can be built and tested locally on dev/test server and final images can be then deployed to Notary Nodes and then started.
- version control
- sharing images - operators can build an image once, share, and then everybody can deploy that same image on their own servers
- minimal overhead
- high availability - in case of failure, in a multi-node setup, containers can be started on another node of the same cluster
- scalability - new nodes can be added to the cluster to expand its capacity

Github's Octocat was designed by Simon Oxley, alongside the white bird Twitter used (before they received a proper logo) as part of a usual routine of cranking out images for iStock. GitHub saw it, and wanted it, presumably under the notion that it can represent how complex code combines to create peculiar things, much like the octopuss... except the CEO of GitHub called it an octocat, and it has been the octocat since <a href="https://www.quora.com/GitHub/What-is-the-story-behind-GitHub%E2%80%99s-octocat-mascot" target="_blank">[via]</a>.

<small>
Octocat is Github's logo and trademark and here is used to illustrate a fictional character (John Smith) that used the *{ Personal }* Jekyll Theme to build his website.
